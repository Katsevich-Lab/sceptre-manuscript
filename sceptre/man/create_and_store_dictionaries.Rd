\title{Create and store dictionaries}
\usage{
create_and_store_dictionaries(
  gRNA_gene_pairs,
  gene_precomp_dir,
  gRNA_precomp_dir,
  results_dir,
  pod_sizes
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gRNA_gene_pairs}{a tible containing a the gene-gRNA pairs to analyze using sceptre. The column names should be "gene_id" and "gRNA_id."}

\item{gene_precomp_dir}{the directory in which to store the gene precomputations}

\item{gRNA_precomp_dir}{the directory in which to store the gRNA precomputations}

\item{results_dir}{the directory in which to store the results}

\item{pod_sizes}{an integer vector with three named elements: gRNA, gene, and pair. These elements give the sizes of the respective "pods."}
}
\value{
a character vector containing the file paths to the gene, gRNA, and results dictionaries.
}
\description{
We require a few bookkeeping files (that we call "dictionaries") for the gRNA and gene precomputation steps. This file creates those dictionaries and stores them in the appropriate locations on disk.
