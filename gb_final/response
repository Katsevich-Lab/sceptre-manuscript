Dear Dr. Pang,

Thank you for the helpful feedback and positive comments on our manuscript. We have implemented all the minor technical fixes that you indicated, including uploading a copy of the analysis code to Zenodo.

With respect to the interpretation of GWAS variants in this manuscript, thank you for understanding our concern about excessive overlap with the other manuscript (Morris 2020). We note that a preprint of Morris 2020 is available on BioRxiv and is referenced in the manuscript (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.250092). We are working diligently on a revision of Morris 2020, and we expect to submit the revision within the next two months.

Thank you for your helpfulness and understanding. Please let us know if there are other changes that we should make to ensure the manuscript is suitable for publication.

Sincerely,
Tim Barry
